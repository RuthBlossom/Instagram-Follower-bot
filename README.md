DISCLAIMER: Ethical Considerations

This script is created for educational purposes only and to explore the capabilities of automation using Selenium WebDriver. Automating interactions on social media platforms, such as Instagram, raises ethical concerns, including privacy issues, violation of terms of service, and potential disruption of user experience.

Using automation to follow users on Instagram without their explicit consent can be considered spammy behavior and may lead to account suspension or termination. Additionally, mass following users may not align with Instagram's community guidelines and could negatively impact the platform's ecosystem.

It's essential to respect the terms of service and community guidelines of online platforms and to consider the ethical implications of automated actions. This script should not be used for commercial purposes or to engage in activities that violate the rights and privacy of others.

By providing this script, we aim to promote learning and understanding of automation techniques while emphasizing the importance of ethical use and responsible behavior in the digital landscape.
